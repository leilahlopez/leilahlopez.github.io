                I’m a passionate software engineer with over 4 years of experience crafting digital products that make a difference. My journey began with a deep curiosity, a love of learning, and a drive to challenge myself, which eventually evolved into strong expertise in modern full-stack technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having grown up tinkering with technology since the days of floppy disks and DOS games, and understanding the profound impact technology has on our world through continual expansion, innovation, and real-world problem solving, it felt natural to transition into software development after the pandemic closed the door on my classical music teaching career. Shaped by my education and classical music background, I strongly believe learning is a lifelong journey, and that curiosity, paired with self-discipline, forms a powerful foundation for growth. After all, true understanding comes when you can explain complex ideas simply, even to a young child.
              </p>
              <p> 
                I now specialize in React, Next.js, and TypeScript, building everything from sleek landing pages to complex, full-scale enterprise applications. My work emphasizes technical excellence alongside thoughtful design, with a strong focus on creating intuitive and accessible user experiences, especially for neurodiverse users.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of coding, I’m deeply interested in learning about audio engineering and music technology, exploring chess as a tool for strategic thinking, and studying neuroscience and cognition to better understand how people learn and interact with complex systems.
